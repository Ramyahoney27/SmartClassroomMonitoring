# Smart Classroom Monitoring System

## Overview
This project proposes the design and implementation of a noise sensor with a buzzer to monitor and control the noise level in a classroom setting. The microcontroller analyzes noise levels in real-time and triggers a buzzer alarm if the sound level exceeds a predetermined threshold. The system is designed to provide an efficient way to manage classroom noise and improve the learning environment for students.

## Features
- Real-time noise monitoring
- Buzzer alerts for high noise levels
- Audio playback feature for college prayer song
- Reminder feature for upcoming events are scheduled and announcing with the help of  speakers
