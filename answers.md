Django Evaluation
Problem set-3 

A.Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?
 I chose cron for scheduling periodic tasks because it is widely supported, lightweight, and has been around for a long time, making it a reliable option. It is available on most Unix-like systems, including Linux, macOS, and BSD, which means it can be easily integrated into existing infrastructure. Cron works by allowing users to define scheduled commands or scripts in a crontab file. The crontab file specifies the schedule and the command to be executed. For example, to download a list of ISINs every 24 hours, you can create a cron job that runs a specific script or command at the desired interval. While cron is reliable for basic periodic task scheduling, it does have limitations when it comes to scaling. Cron is designed for single-server environments and lacks built-in support for distributed systems. If the workload increases significantly or if you need more advanced features like task coordination, fault tolerance, or centralized management, cron may not be sufficient. To address scalability and additional requirements in a production environment, I would recommend using a distributed task scheduler like Apache Airflow or Celery. These frameworks provide more advanced scheduling capabilities, fault tolerance, and scalability options. They can distribute tasks across multiple servers, handle task dependencies, retries, and monitor task execution. Additionally, they often come with web-based interfaces for task management and monitoring. 
     
B.In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa?
 Flask and Django are both popular web frameworks in Python, but they have different strengths and are suitable for different circumstances. Flask is a lightweight and minimalist web framework that is often used for smaller projects or APIs. It is known for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to have more control over the structure and components of their application. Flask is a good choice when you need a simple, fast, and customizable solution. It is easy to get started with and has a smaller learning curve compared to Django. Django, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive and feature-rich web framework. It provides a batteries-included approach, offering many built-in components and features such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction, authentication, admin interface, and more. Django is well-suited for larger projects or applications that require rapid development, as it provides a high-level of abstraction and automates many common tasks. It has a strong emphasis on convention over configuration.
